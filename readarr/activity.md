## Activity

This set of screens show current and past activity performed by Readarr.

## Queue

When something is actively downloading and not yet imported into Readarr, it will show in the Queue page.

In the image above, the ebook is downloading, and not yet complete. The arrow is black, which means it has no current issues, and the progress bar is still filling in. You can cancel the download by clicking on the `X` on the right.

> For Usenet indexers, Readarr will only look 60 items deep in the queue for potential imports! It is important not to exceed this, or you will need to clean up with manual imports when your system gets overloaded and starts missing items!

If an item needs a human to review it and make a decision, it will be orange on the left icon. Hovering over it will show you the specific error. If you think you can manually import it anyway, click the "person" icon on the right.  In the example above, the book is correct, but the matching percentage is too low to be sure, so Readarr needs your help to decide if it's really the book it thinks it is.  Since it is, I will click on the person icon.

Make sure the author and book match, and click `Import`.
