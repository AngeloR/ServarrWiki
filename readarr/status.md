# Readarr Status

## 2024-05-14 Search is down

Searching is currently down. I will advise when it's back up. This will impact adding new authors, books, and manual imports where searches are required to function.

## 2024-04-17 Metadata is alive (with issues)

The current state of the Readarr metadata server: 
1. It's functioning, approximately 3 months behind. If you have a book that was added to Goodreads less than 3 months ago, it probably is 1  to show up yet.
2. Large authors are still not working, and will not be for a while. A partial, but **not exhaustive**, list of those authors:     
    - Stephen King
    - Isaac Asimov
    - Leo Tolstoy
    - Fyodor Dostoevsky
    - Arthur Conan Doyle
    - Stephen Fry
    - Agatha Christie
    - Arthur C. Clarke
    - Oscar Wilde
    - Jack London
    - Neil Gaiman
    - Charles Dickens
1. For large authors, you cannot do anything to add either the author OR their individual books. There is no workaround.
