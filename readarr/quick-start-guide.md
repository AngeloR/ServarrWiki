# Quick Start Guide
In this guide we will try to explain the basic setup you need to do to get started as quickly as possible with Readarr.

There are a lot more settings you may need or want. They can be found at the [settings]( /readarr/settings) page.

> Please note that within the screenshots and GUI settings in `orange` are advanced options, so you'll need to enable those to make them visible.

After installation and starting up, you open a browser and go to `http://ip_where_installed:8787`

## Media Management

First weâ€™re going to take a look at the <code>Media Management</code> settings where we can setup our preferred naming and file management settings.
