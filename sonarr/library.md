## Series

The series page shows your entire library, and allows you to select individual series (however searching can be more efficient in large libraries) and make searches for specific series, as well as being able to edit them.  It also allows you to filter your series.

## Filters

The filters options allows you to narrow your series down, and is incredibly helpful.  It can be used to see release dates, names, episode counts, disk size counts, and too much more to list, including custom filters, to fit your every need.  These can also be used in the mass editor.

## Add New

The add new feature allows you to add a new series for Sonarr to monitor and download.  You have a variety of options when doing this, you can use an assortment of monitor features (i.e, only download the newest season, first season, new episodes, entire show, missing episodes, and pilot episode).  As well as being able to choose the media path, and Series type (Standard, Daily, and Anime).

## Library Import

The library import allows you to import series (and their seasond & episodes) into Sonarr via existing files in the path directory.  This is especially useful when making a new Sonarr instance and wanting to keep your existing series.

## Mass Editor

The mass editor allows you to edit series in mass.  Such as changing any of the previous settings made when you added the series.

## Season Pass

Information about how many seasons every series has and how many episodes in each season are missing.
