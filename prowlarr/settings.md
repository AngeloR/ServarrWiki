# Settings

This page will go through all the settings available in Prowlarr and how they work.  This is not meant to be a comprehensive "how to set up Prowlarr." If you want that, please use the [Quick Start](/prowlarr/quick-start-guide) page instead.

## Menu options

To get to the Settings page, please choose Settings from the left menu. The following sub-menu options will be available:

Also, note that for each individual settings page, there are some options at the top of the menu:

![settings_2_topmenu.png](/assets/prowlarr/settings_2_topmenu.png)

- Hide/Show advanced is important for any items that are marked below as `(Advanced Option)`, otherwise they will not show up. These menu items are shown in orange in the screenshots.

- You must save your changes before leaving the screen. You do that by clicking the disk icon. If you've made no changes, it will show "No Changes" and be grayed out, as shown above.

## Applications

Here is where you will add the applications that use Prowlarr (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, Readarr, etc.) and how they stay in sync with Prowlarr.
