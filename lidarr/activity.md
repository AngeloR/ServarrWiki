## Queue

The queue page allows you to view what is currently in progress or "to be done", it is a practical "to-do list" for all Lidarr operations that can be manually incited by a user.  Actions are signified with icons, and fall into failures, grabs, imports, and downloads requiring human input (yellow import symbol).

## History

The history page shows all operations previously completed via Lidarr, such as imports, grabs, deletes, fails, and downloads requiring human input (yellow import symbol).

## Blacklist

The blacklist tab shows all the attempted grabs that upon downloading, failed.  This can also be done manually by a user, in the queue tab.
