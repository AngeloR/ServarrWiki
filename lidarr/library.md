The library page is where are all your artists are listed, as well as the progress (amount of tracks available/unavailable). It is here where you can filter your library, and even create customer filters. You can also select individual artists to view tracks (available or missing) and albums, as well make edits to their search profile, monitoring, paths, and anything you can do via the "Add New" tab. It is the landing page and practical heart of Lidarr.
